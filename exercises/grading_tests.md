1. Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. 

2. If the score is out of range, print an error. 

3. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:


Score Grade

\>= 0.8 B

\>= 0.7 C

\>= 0.6 D

< 0.6 F

If the user enters a value out of range, print a suitable error message and exit. For the test, enter a score of 0.85.
