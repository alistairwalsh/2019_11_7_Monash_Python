## Python 

__7th November__

### Bring

- A laptop (tablets won't work, it needs to be a laptop). You will also need to install software on it so work laptops often won't work. If you can install anaconda, that's a pretty good test.

- Please install Anaconda before you come.

- You might want a notepad and pencil to jot down ideas.

Hi! Welcome to the first day of the course. On the setup page is a link to the Anaconda package manager. You can download the version for your operating system and install it ready for the workshop.

<span style="color:blue">N.B. You don't need to install anything other than the Anaconda package. All the other libraries are included or we'll install them during the workshop.

On the first day we'll have an introduction to Python and programming concepts and an intro to Pandas, which is a Python library for handling spreadsheet like data.

The Anaconda installation manager makes using Python so much easier than running it from the command line and includes the Jupyter Notebook IDE. The jupyter notebook is an amazing way to develop your Python programs and see graphs and other output.

The main focus is to discuss Syntax and programmatic thinking. We'll cover importing Python libraries, writing Python code and creating a program.

Then we'll look at Pandas, which is essential for data wrangling.
